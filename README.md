Computer Assignment #4, Artificial Intelligence Course, University of Tehran

The aim of this project is to get acquainted with **Machine Learning** methods through the ```Sickit-Learn``` library.

In this project, using several classifiers defined in the Sickit-Learn library, such as ```K-Nearest-Neighbors``` and ```Decision tree```, we implemented and optimized models, and at the end, we implemented several group learning methods such as ```Random Forest```.
